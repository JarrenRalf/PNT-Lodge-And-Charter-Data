How does this spreadsheet benefit Pacific Net & Twine?
- This spreadsheet allows the users to serarch by item for the total sales quantities each year, important for the purposes of purchasing inventory at the beginning of the year.
- Customer's are always asking about items that they previously ordered, so one of our search pages can find their past invoices and it is search able by using keywords of items that are contained on those orders.
